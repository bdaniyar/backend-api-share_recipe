üç≥ Share Recipe

A fullstack recipe-sharing application built with FastAPI (backend) and Next.js (frontend).
Features authentication, JWT tokens, saving & liking recipes, and commenting.

üîß Tech Stack
	‚Ä¢	Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Next.js (React)
    ‚Ä¢	Database: PostgreSQ
    ‚Ä¢	Auth: JWT, Google OAuth
	‚Ä¢	Infra: Docker, Docker Compose


üöÄ Getting Started


Backend
	1.	Create a virtual environment (recommended):

        cd share-recipe-frontend/backend
        python3 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
        .venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    2.	Set up environment variables:
        Create .env in backend/app/config/ with (examples):
            ‚Ä¢ DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./dev.db
            ‚Ä¢ SECRET_KEY=dev-secret
            ‚Ä¢ ALGORITHM=HS256
            ‚Ä¢ ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
            ‚Ä¢ REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
            ‚Ä¢ SMTP_HOST=localhost (if email confirmations used)
            ‚Ä¢ ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
            ‚Ä¢ ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
            ‚Ä¢ SESSION_SECRET=dev-session-secret
            ‚Ä¢ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=... (optional for OAuth)
            ‚Ä¢ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
    
     3.	Initialize the database:
        alembic revision --autogenerate -m "sync models"
        alembic upgrade head

     4.	Run the backend server:
        uvicorn app.main:app --reload
            ‚Ä¢ API base: http://localhost:8000
            ‚Ä¢ Static media is served under /media
            ‚Ä¢ Admin panel: http://localhost:8000/admin
    5. Docker
        docker-compose up --build

Admin panel (SQLAdmin)
    ‚Ä¢ Path: /admin
    ‚Ä¢ Auth: simple session auth. Credentials come from env vars ADMIN_USERNAME/ADMIN_PASSWORD
      (defaults admin/admin in development). SESSION_SECRET (or SECRET_KEY) is required for sessions.
    ‚Ä¢ Uses a dedicated synchronous SQLAlchemy engine under the hood to avoid async driver issues.

CORS (development)
    ‚Ä¢ Configured to allow http://localhost:3000 

Frontend
	1.	Install dependencies and start the dev server:
        cd ../
        npm install
        npm run dev
    2.	Open the app at: http://localhost:3000
	3.	Configure API base URL for frontend:
        # .env.local
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    Restart the dev server after changes.

üß™ Tests

Run backend tests with pytest from the backend folder (ensures imports and settings are resolved):

    cd share-recipe-frontend/backend
    # Ensure required env vars are set. Example minimal local setup:
    export DATABASE_URL="sqlite+aiosqlite:///./test.db"
    export SECRET_KEY="test-secret"
    export ALGORITHM="HS256"
    # If email confirmation is enabled, also set SMTP/EMAIL vars, or tests will override as needed.
    pytest -v

Notes about tests
    ‚Ä¢ Tests use an async SQLite database per test and patch the app's session factory.
    ‚Ä¢ App startup/shutdown events are disabled during tests (to avoid external services like Redis).
    ‚Ä¢ Fixtures provide anonymous and authorized clients; add header X-Test-Auth: 1 to simulate auth where needed.
    ‚Ä¢ Full suite should pass: 19 tests.
